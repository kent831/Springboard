    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",

Recall that in the previous assignment, we introduced the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and its consequence that the distributions of sample statistics approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases. The amazing thing about this is that it applies to the sampling distributions of statistics that have been calculated from even highly non-normal distributions of data! Recall, also, that hypothesis testing is very much based on making inferences about such sample statistics. You're going to rely heavily on the CLT to apply frequentist (parametric) tests to answer the questions in this notebook."
